<h2>{% trans "What is Genitura?" %}</h2>

 <p>{% blocktrans %}Genitura is a PHP framework created by Heptacube engineers for optimizing Web applications development. It takes advantage of the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to shorten development time, boost quality and simplify maintenance of PHP applications.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>Why use a framework?</h2>

<p>Using a software framework for developing applications, in this case a PHP Web application, has the advantage of building consistency throughout an individual or company's work. Building multiple applications with the same framework usually makes them similar and simple in structure, therefore making it easier for multiple people to work on the same project, or for someone to take over the work started by someone else. </p>
